  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p id="about-preview">
    Hi, I’m Kevin Hoang Nguyen — a dedicated real estate professional with a deep understanding of the Houston metropolitan area.
    <span id="dots">...</span>
  </p>

  <div id="about-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>Having lived in Alief, Sugar Land, Cypress, Richmond, and Fulshear, I bring firsthand knowledge of these dynamic communities. I’ve also spent significant time in Bellaire and Katy, and frequently visited Missouri City and Rosenberg, giving me valuable insights into the unique characteristics and opportunities each of these areas offers.</p>

    <p>I’ve had the privilege of helping over 30 clients from diverse backgrounds find their perfect homes. Each experience has only strengthened my passion for making the home-buying and leasing process smooth and enjoyable. With a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity, I know how to leverage technology to better serve my clients — whether that’s using advanced tools for property searches or ensuring secure communication and data handling.</p>

    <p>I started my real estate career at just 21 years old, bringing youthful energy, a fresh perspective, and plenty of time to dedicate to my clients' success. My strong base of repeat clients reflects my commitment to excellent service, market expertise, and a personalized approach — along with a growing understanding of real estate investment opportunities.</p>

    <p>When challenges arise, I lean on my trusted network of experienced professionals to make sure my clients always receive the best guidance possible.</p>

    <p>Whether you're buying, selling, or leasing, you can count on me to work tirelessly on your behalf.</p>

    <p>Let’s make your real estate journey seamless and rewarding!</p>
